[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lidaobing/capistrano-scm-jenkins.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lidaobing/capistrano-scm-jenkins) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-scm-jenkins.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-scm-jenkins) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/lidaobing/capistrano-scm-jenkins.png)](https://gemnasium.com/lidaobing/capistrano-scm-jenkins)


Allows Capistrano to treat Jenkins as an SCM, deploying artifacts from a specified job.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano-scm-jenkins'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install capistrano-scm-jenkins
```

## Usage

In your `Capfile`, youâ€™ll need to `require 'capistrano-scm-jenkins`.

A sample `config/deploy.rb`:

```ruby
set :application, 'my-sweet-app'
set :repo_url, 'http://my.jenkins.install/job/my-sweet-app'
set :deploy_to, "/home/#{fetch(:user)}/#{fetch(:application)}"

# Jenkins username & password
set :jenkins_user, 'user'
set :jenkins_pass, 'pass'

# Allow the deployment of unstable versions
# set :jenkins_use_unstable, true

# Deploy from artifact subfolder. (ex: mv zipout/#{:jenkins_artifact_path} #{destination})
# set :jenkins_artifact_path, 'archive'
#
# Deploy a single file.
# set :jenkins_artifact_file, 'my-api/target/webapp.war'
#
# Deploy a specific build number
# set(:jenkins_build_number, ENV['REVISION']) if ENV['REVISION']
#
# Bypass SSL verification
# set :jenkins_insecure, true
```

### maven module

For a Maven module, you should include the module name in the `:repo_url`:

```ruby
set :repo_url,  "http://jenkins.example.com/job/example/com.example.helloworld$helloworld/"
```
